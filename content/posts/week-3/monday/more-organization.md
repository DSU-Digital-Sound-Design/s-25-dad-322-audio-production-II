## Optimizing Track Grouping for Unified Control

In complex audio projects, it's common to capture an instrument using multiple microphones. To streamline your mixing process, consider grouping these tracks. This practice allows simultaneous control over the collective volume and other parameters, ensuring a cohesive sound.

### Steps to Group Tracks:

1. **Identify and Select Tracks**: Begin by pinpointing the instruments in your project recorded with more than one microphone.
2. **Initiate Grouping**: After selecting the desired tracks, press "Shift + G" to access the grouping menu.
3. **Configure Group Settings**:
    - Choose "All" to link all track parameters, providing unified control over the group.
    - For individual parameter adjustments within a group, press "Shift", then select the specific parameter you wish to modify independently.

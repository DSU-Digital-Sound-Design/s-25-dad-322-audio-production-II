### Summary of "5 References For Low End â€¦and why they're so useful!"

[Low-end mixing references](../CambridgeMT_5BassReferences.pdf)

**Introduction**
- In small studio mixing, achieving a high-quality low-end spectrum in music is challenging. Many project-studio mixes lack impressive low-end bass, despite having great vocals and instruments.

**Importance of Reference Tracks**
- Reference tracks from commercial releases are crucial for improving low-end mixing. They serve three key roles:
  - Evaluating and refining the monitoring setup.
  - Providing context for low-end mixing decisions.
  - Offering exemplary models to challenge and improve mixing skills.

## A Jury of Your Peers in Mix Evaluation

- Soliciting external feedback is crucial for objective mix assessment.
- Even skilled mixers can lose objectivity, making external perspectives invaluable.
- Learning to filter and apply feedback constructively enhances mixing skills.
- Using reference tracks can clarify vague feedback and guide mix adjustments.

{{% note %}}

- Professional mixing involves not just technical skill but also the courage to face critique. By the end of the mixing process, the mixer's own ears are likely the least objective judge of the mix, making external feedback essential.
- Experienced mixers like Alan Moulder and Alan Parsons emphasize the value of collaboration and external input for maintaining objectivity and achieving high-quality results.
- While feedback is crucial, it's equally important to discern which critiques are constructive and aligned with the mix's intended style and which may be subjective preferences or genre-specific biases.
- When feedback seems vague or contradictory, especially from non-musicians, using reference tracks can provide a concrete basis for comparison, helping to clarify the intended direction for mix adjustments.

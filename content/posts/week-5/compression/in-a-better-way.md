Why do we use compression?

We want to try to reduce the dynamic range for certain instruments. The dynamic range is the difference between the loudest and quietest sounds. The louder parts will get quieter and the quieter parts will get louder.

If tracks have too much dynamic range they can stick out of a mix in an unpleasant way. If a track has too little dynamic range overall it can sound boring and lifeless.

- Basic parameters - threshold, makeup gain
- different types of compressors
- start to bring in tracks one by one from our mix, adding compression where necessary. We'll look for tracks that we can't find stable fader settings for because they vary too much in volume. Do certain sections poke out too much or get lost because their too quiet?

First let's look at [some compression examples](https://cambridge-mt.com/ms/ch9/) from the book. -->

## Compression in Better Way

Steps:

1. Before I start, I'm going to offset all of the fader values to the clip gain so that my faders are all at 0 dB. I'm using a script called "X-Raym_Offset selected items volume by their track fader value", which you can get from ReaPack. See [this video](https://youtu.be/gVbMbqGSB7E?t=369) for a description of how to install extensions for Reaper.
2. Pick a compressor, i'll use ReaComp or MCompressor.
3. Set the threshold and makeup gain
4. Listen for how the track sounds in the mix. Does it sound better or worse? In context of the song, we'll try to back off of the compression to see if we can use less.
5. Do we need to change the level of any of the media items before they get to the compressor for more consistent inputs?

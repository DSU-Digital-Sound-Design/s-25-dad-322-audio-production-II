# Balance 

- Mixing demands a clear, overarching game plan to make confident decisions.
- Learning to mix is a step-by-step process, analogous to learning to drive, starting with mastering basic techniques before progressing to the more complex nuanced skills.
- The most important aspect of mixing is achieving balance, ensuring every important sound is clear and appropriately leveled throughout the mix.

# What order do you start mixing in?

- The sequence of mixing different instruments and sections in a production is crucial, significantly influencing the final sound quality.
- Establishing a logical starting point in the mixing process is vital for making sense of and effectively managing the mixing workflow.

## Start with the most important section

Before setting the most important section, we should add regions around the sections so that we can easily see where sections start and end.

What is the most important section of this song?

> “I’ll start with the louder or bigger section [with] the most instruments . . . the chorus typically, or maybe the bridge” says Neal Avron, for instance. “And then the rest of it is kind of ‘unbuilding’ for the verses and the intros.”

After we pick the most important section we'll start the mix there. From that point we can mix the other sections related to that one, making sure to leave the most important section the loudest and most upfront.

We might design the dynamic structure of a mix like this:

The choruses are the most important parts so we mix all of those first.

## Start with the Most Important Instrument

Now that we've chosen the structure our mix will take, we have to find the most important instrument. What is that for this song? We'll bring up this fader first, then decide what else is important and go in that order. If we go in the correct order, we can avoid over-processing when we try to squeeze instruments into a space.

Let's each of us in class write down a list of what we think the most important instruments are in order. We'll discuss why and try to stick to our plan.

## A Basic three-step process for balancing

> - **Unwanted Low Frequencies:** Begin by removing any unnecessary low frequencies from instruments recorded to their mono audio file. This step is crucial for maintaining clarity in the mix.
> - **Pan Control Adjustment:** Next, adjust the pan control to position the instrument appropriately within the stereo field. Proper panning contributes significantly to the perceived spaciousness and organization of the mix.
> - **Fader Level Setting:** Finally, set the fader level to achieve the desired prominence of the instrument in the mix. This step is about finding the right balance where the instrument sits well with others while contributing effectively to the overall mix.

### High-pass filtering

High-pass filtering is an essential process in mixing, primarily used for cleaning up the low end of the track by removing unnecessary low frequencies. Below is an overview of its importance, usage, and best practices in the context of mixing.

#### Function of High-Pass Filter:
- **Basic Operation:** A high-pass filter progressively attenuates frequencies below a user-defined cutoff frequency, effectively "cleaning" the low end of the track.
- **Slope Control:** The steepness of the attenuation is measured in decibels per octave (dB/octave). Common slopes are 6dB (1-pole), 12dB (2-pole), and 18dB (3-pole) per octave. More extreme slopes like 72dB/octave are available but can introduce audio artifacts.
- **Filter Designs:** Some filters offer a Resonance, Bandwidth, or Q control, providing a level boost at the cutoff frequency. However, for general mix cleanup, this feature is less relevant and should be set to minimum.

#### Practical Application in Mixing:
- **Choosing the Right Tool:** For mixing purposes, high-pass filters integrated into equalizer plugins are generally preferred for their transparency, as opposed to those with resonance controls more suited for sound-design tasks.
- **Setting the Cutoff Frequency:**
  - A practical method is to increase the cutoff frequency until a change in the sound's low end is noticeable, then slightly reduce it.
  - This approach ensures that unnecessary low frequencies are removed without compromising the instrument's essential character.
  - For home studios, using a spectrum analyzer can offer additional insight, especially when monitoring conditions are not ideal.
  
#### Specific Considerations:
- **Instrument-Specific Filtering:** While the technique is broadly applicable, attention should be paid to instruments with significant low-frequency content, like kick drums, snares, and bass.
  - For these instruments, high-pass filtering can sometimes affect the attack or punch of the sound. Therefore, setting the cutoff frequency lower and listening carefully for any negative impact on the drum's attack is crucial.

### Pan control adjustment

- **Subjective Nature:** Panning decisions in mixing often boil down to the mix engineer's personal taste, rather than adherence to a strict notion of stereo realism. While some engineers aim for a natural stereo panorama, mainstream record production frequently involves panning for technical reasons or based on the engineer's preference.
- **LCR (Left-Center-Right) Panning:** Some engineers advocate for LCR panning, positioning elements strictly at left, center, or right. This approach simplifies the stereo field but may not always provide the desired spatial depth or realism in the mix.

#### Technical Considerations and Strategies:
- **Central Positioning for Key Elements:** Vital musical elements like kick, snare, bass, and lead vocals are typically placed in the center. This ensures they are prominent in mono playback and benefit from the combined low-frequency response of stereo speakers.  
- **Mono Compatibility:** When panning, consider how the balance will change in mono or single-sided stereo. Panning towards the extremes can cause a 3dB level drop in mono, potentially making an instrument less audible or even inaudible in one earbud.
- **Opposition Panning:** Balance the stereo field by panning similar or complementary instruments to opposite sides. This technique, known as opposition panning, helps to maintain a balanced stereo image and ensures clarity and separation between similar instruments (e.g., hi-hat and shaker).
- **Call-and-Response Panning:** Push call-and-response elements to opposite sides to enhance interaction and contrast within the mix. This technique can be particularly effective with guitar riffs, sound effects, and backing vocals. 
- **Dynamic Panning:** Consider dynamic panning, where elements are positioned differently in various sections of the song (e.g., something panned left in the verse answered by something on the right in the chorus), as suggested by Bob Clearmountain. This approach adds variety and maintains interest throughout the track.

### Fader level setting

- **Foundational Step:** Setting levels is a fundamental step in mixing, crucial for preventing distortion and ensuring each track sits correctly in the mix's overall soundscape.  
- **DAW Headroom and Noise Floor:** Modern DAWs, with their floating-point processing, offer virtually unlimited headroom and a non-existent noise floor, allowing for a wide latitude in setting levels without the risk of distortion or quality loss.

#### Strategies for Level Setting:
- **Avoiding Overloading:** Despite the ample headroom, it's wise to avoid channel and bus overloads for practical reasons, like the ability to export unclipped mix stems.
- **Processor Level Impact:** The level at which signals hit mix processors (discussed later) can significantly affect the overall sonic character.

#### Importance of Diligent Level Balancing:
- **Time and Attention Requirement:** Balancing levels is a time-intensive task requiring close attention. It's essential not to rush this stage as it sets the foundation for the mix.
- **Monitoring and Reference Practices:** Employing good monitoring practices, using different listening setups, and occasionally referencing commercial tracks can provide a comprehensive perspective on the balance.
- **Balance and Trade-offs:** Achieving balance involves trade-offs between making each track audible and distinct without overshadowing others. Continuous assessment and adjustment are key to maintaining harmony among all mix elements.

#### Moving Forward with Level Setting:
- **Preliminary Decisions:** Make informed initial fader settings to minimize the need for extensive processing later. Stay attentive to the balance and be ready to employ plugins where necessary.
- **Ongoing Adjustment and Reference:** Understand that the initial balance is a starting point. The final, polished balance often requires ongoing adjustments, processing, and referencing against commercial productions for a well-rounded and competitive mix.

### In-depth Mixing Process for "Better Way"

#### Starting with Drums

**Overhead and Cymbals (SnareCymbals Track):**
   - **Initial Focus:** Start "SnareCymbals" for a comprehensive view of the drum kit's sound.
   - **Mono Compatibility Check:** Use the mono switch to identify any phase issues, especially for cymbals which can lose presence in mono.
   - **High-Pass Filtering:** Implement a high-pass filter at 20 Hz to eliminate subsonic rumble, ensuring a clean low-end.
   - **Level Setting:** Adjust the fader to reach around -18 dB on the master, establishing a foundational level for the drums.

**Snare (Snaps as Snare):**
   - **No Dedicated Snare Track:** If there's no separate snare track, use an alternative like snaps to represent the snare sound.
   - **High-Pass Filtering and Leveling:** Apply a high-pass filter at 20 Hz and set the level to complement the "SnareCymbals" track, maintaining balance within the drum kit.

**Kick Drum:**
   - **High-Pass Filtering:** Carefully apply a high-pass filter if necessary, being mindful not to remove the kick's punch. Use a spectrum analyzer like Span to visually confirm the filter's impact.
   - **Level Adjustment:** Set the kick level relative to the snare and cymbals, ensuring a cohesive drum mix. Regularly switch between speaker sets to confirm the balance across different listening environments.

**Shakers and Other Drum Elements:**
   - **Final Touches:** Introduce shakers to add rhythm and texture. Gradually bring in the remaining drum elements, checking their balance against the established drum mix.

#### Moving to Bass

- **High-Pass Filtering:** Apply a high-pass filter at 20 Hz to clean up any low-end rumble, ensuring clarity in the bass frequencies.

#### Mixing Other Instruments

- **Step-by-Step Approach:** Continue the process used for drums and bass, applying high-pass filtering where necessary and carefully setting levels to maintain a balanced mix.

#### Finishing Up

- **Fader-to-Item Volume Transfer:** Use the script "_Script: X-Raym_Offset selected items volume by their track fader value.lua_" to transfer fader levels to individual track items. This allows for later adjustments or automation without altering the foundational mix balance.
- **Speaker Switching and Breaks:** Frequently switch listening setups and take breaks to ensure a fresh perspective. Vary listening levels to gauge the mix's performance across different volume ranges.
- **Final Level Check:** Aim for a balanced mix with the master track peaking no higher than -6 dB, ensuring sufficient headroom for mastering.

## In-depth process for our song "Better Way"

### Drums

Usually we start with the drums for music like this. In drum recordings, having good sounding overheads is a nice place to start. These multitracks have a strangely recorded "SnareCymbals" track. We'll start with that.

If we toggle the mono switch to check for mono compatibility you can hear that the cymbals are getting lost in mono. Zoom in on the waveform to check for phase issues. Mike Senior uses a channel delay trick, but that only seems to make our mix worse, so we won't use it.

Add a high pass filter at 20 hZ to cut out subsonic rumble. Raise the fader until you're reaching about -18 dB on the master.

> I docked my mixer on the left side of my screen so I can see it more clearly.

This track doesn't have a dedicated snare track, so we'll treat the snaps at the snare and mix those next. High pass filter the track at 20 hZ. Set the level relative to the snare cymbals track.

Now we'll move onto the kick. We can try to hpf this, but it might not be necessary. Listen carefully if you're cutting out punch with the filter. Check to see if anything is actually happening with Span on your master track.

> Mike Senior is checking polarity often in the video. This is because he's mixing multimiced drums. Our drums were are not multimiced, so we don't need to worry about that.

Now, set the level of the kick to the snare and snarecymbals. Be sure to listen with both sets of speakers. Finally introduce the shakers to round out the drums.

Go to an earlier section of the song and bring in the other drum elements.

## Bass

- high pass at 20 hZ

## Other instruments

Continue the above

## Finishing up

After we're done we'll use the script _Script: X-Raym_Offset selected items volume by their track fader value.lua_ to copy the values of the faders to our media item volumes. We do this so that we can use the faders later for automation or further mixing.

Be sure to switch speakers often to get a good idea of how the balance will sound on different systems and that you're not deceiving yourself. Take lots of breaks and vary your listening levels.

I'm aiming to have everything sounding balanced, while having the master track not go above -6 dB. -->

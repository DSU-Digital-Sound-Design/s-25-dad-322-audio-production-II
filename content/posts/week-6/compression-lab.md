### Overview

This lab is designed to introduce students to the practical application of compression in audio mixing. Through the installation and experimentation with various compressors, students will learn how to manipulate dynamics to achieve a balanced mix. The lab will focus on applying compression to drums and vocals within a mix.

### Objectives

- Understand the function and impact of compression in audio mixing.
- Experiment with different types of compressors to observe their unique characteristics.
- Apply compression to various elements within a mix to achieve balance and cohesion.

### Required Materials

- The Hurray For the Riff Raff drum editing project (or a similar multi-track drum recording).
- Vocal sample to apply compression to.

### Step 1: Preparation

#### Download and Install Compressors

1. **MCompressor**: Visit [MeldaProduction](https://www.meldaproduction.com/MCompressor) to download and install MCompressor.
2. **RoughRider 3**: Go to [Audio Damage Free And Legacy Products](https://www.audiodamage.com/pages/free-and-legacy) and download RoughRider 3.
3. **TDR Kotelnikov**: Download TDR Kotelnikov from [Tokyo Dawn Records](https://www.tokyodawn.net/tdr-kotelnikov/).


#### Explore Compressor Settings

- Spend a minute with each compressor, familiarizing yourself with its interface and settings.
- Consult the provided documentation for each plugin if you're unsure about the function of any parameters.

### Step 2: Applying Compression to Drums

#### Compress the Kick Drum

1. Open the Hurray For the Riff Raff drum editing project.
2. Insert ReaComp (or your chosen compressor) on the kick drum track.
3. Enable auto-makeup gain if available.
4. Set the compression ratio to 4:1.

#### Apply to Other Drums

- Repeat the process for other kick and snare tracks, followed by the hi-hats.
- As you add compressors, use the "Project Media Bay/FX" view to bypass all compressors. This allows you to hear the cumulative effect of the compression.

#### Compress Room Microphones

1. Apply a compressor to the room microphone tracks. Consider using the 1175 Compressor from Reaper or one of the plugins you downloaded.
2. Set the compression ratio to 4:1 and adjust the threshold as needed.
3. Manually adjust the output gain to match the input level.

#### Group Compression

1. Group all drum tracks into a folder.
2. Apply a 1175 compressor to the entire drum group.
3. Experiment with extreme parameter settings to observe their effect on the sound.

### Step 3: Voice Compression

- Apply compression to the vocal track, experimenting with different compressors and settings to achieve a balanced and polished sound.

### Step 4: Comparison and Analysis

- Repeat the drum compression process with a different compressor.
- A/B the results with the initial compression to determine which compressor or settings you prefer.


<!-- ## Class Lab

Let's get some hands on experimenting with balance and compression in your own mixes

- Install a few types of compressors and experiment with them
- [MCompressor](https://www.meldaproduction.com/MCompressor), [RoughRider 3](https://www.audiodamage.com/pages/free-downloads), [TDR Kotelnikov](https://www.tokyodawn.net/tdr-kotelnikov/)

Spend a minute exploring each of these compressor's settings. Look at the documentation if you're unsure of what a parameter does. 

Instructions:

Open the Hurray For the Riff Raff drum editing project we did a few weeks ago. Add ReaComp or another compressor to the kick drum track. Turn on auto-makeup gain if the plugin has that setting. Set the ratio to 4:1. For every 1 dB of input signal we'll decrease the gain by 4 dB. 

Now do the same to the other kicks and snares, then the hi-hats.

As you add plugins, check the "Project Media Bay/FX" view to bypass all compressors at once. Use this to hear the cumulative difference.

Now compress your room microphones, but this time with the 1175 Compressor that comes with Reaper. You could try one of the new plugins aswell. Set the ratio to 4:1. Adjust the threshold to your liking. With this plugin you have to adjust the gain manually. Try to get it back to the input level.

Finally, group all of the drums in a folder and apply a 1175 compressor to the folder. Notice how extreme parameter settings can have a drastic effect on the timbre of the track.

Try this whole process again with at least one other compressor. AB the results and decide which one you prefer.

## Voice Compression

Now add the vocal sample to the project and try to compress it. -->

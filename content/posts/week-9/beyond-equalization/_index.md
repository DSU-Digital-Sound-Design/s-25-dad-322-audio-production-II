# Distortion as a mix tool

Distortion can be a really useful tool to make sounds stick out of a mix without changing their volume. A good use for distortion would be to brighten a bass/synth line with not a lot of higher frequencies. Reaper has several built-in options for us to try:

- Distortion
- Distortion (Fuzz)
- Waveshaping distortion

We'll add this as a parallel track so we can mix the results back in with the original. Let's check out a scope to see the difference in harmonics with these added.

We can also try it on drums, vocals, background vocals, and acoustic guitar.

There are other plugins that we might want to try such as emulations of tape machines, mixing consoles, hardware outboard units, guitar amps, effects pedals, soft-clippers, vacuum tubes, transistors, transformers etc.

Here are some cool freeware plugins:

- Distox by Analog Obsession
- [Cypress TT-15 - free guitar amp head - Black Rooster Audio](https://blackroosteraudio.com/en/products/cypress_tt-15)
- [PA FREE bx_rockrack V3 Player - Plugin Alliance](https://www.plugin-alliance.com/en/products/bx_rockrack_v3_player.html#downloads)
- Medla plugins: MBitFunMac , MSaturatorMac , MWaveFolderMac & MWaveShaperMac
- Voxengo Tube Amp, Boogex
- Native Instruments Guitar Rig 6 - Very slow on my computer
- Many plugins from [Ignite Amps](https://www.igniteamps.com/#software)

Soundtoys (installed on the studio computers) have a few very good plugins for distortion.

- Decapitator
- Radiator
- Devil-Loc Delux
- Devil-Loc
- Little Radiator

# Exciter

Also, add harmonic distortion, but in a different way to distortion plugins. Exciters typically target specific frequency ranges, not the whole signal, like a saturation or distortion plugin.

- JS plugins
  - Exciter
  - Exciter (Treble Enhancer)

# Low-end enhancements

Distortion can add higher frequency components to low-end sounds. But, if you want to add more to a low end of a sound you can use subharmonics processors.

Reaper has a built in plugin called 50 Hz Kicker and another called Thunderkick.

Freeware that I have tried:

- Thump by Metric Halo
- bx_subfilter - this one sounds pretty good

Let's try using Thump on our drum track to add some more low-end to the kick drum. I'll create a send and add Thump to the send. I'll also add a low pass filter so that we're only effecting the low frequencies.

**Drum Triggering**

If this isn't working out so well we can try drum triggering. We can gate the drum track filtering out anything but the kick drum. Then we can send that MIDI data to a sampler and play anything we want.

An alternative is Steven Slates's Trigger 2 Free. It has other useful features if you're doing this a lot.

# Synth pads

We can also add some movement and interest to some of the more static synth pads. Some effects to try:

- Chorus
- Tremolo
- Vibrato

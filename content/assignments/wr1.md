# Edison’s list

## Submit to: D2L

In an article for the North American Review, Thomas Edison (1878)
imagined 10 possible use cases for his new invention of the phonograph:[^1]

1. Letter writing and dictation without the aid of a stenographer.
2. Phonographic books for the blind.
3. The teaching of elocution.
4. Reproduction of music.
5. The “family record” – a registry of sayings, reminiscences, etc.,
   by members of a family in their own voices, and the last words
   of dying persons.
6. Music-boxes and toys.
7. Clocks that should announce in articulate voice the time for
   going home, going to meals, etc.
8. The preservation of languages by exact reproduction of the manner of pronouncing.
9. Educational purposes such as preserving the explanations
   made by a teacher, so that the pupil can refer to them at any moment, and spelling or other lessons placed upon the phonograph
   for convenience in committing to memory.
10. Connection with the telephone, so as to make that instrument
    an auxiliary in the transmission of permanent and invaluable
    records, instead of being the recipient of momentary and fleeting
    communications.

# Instructions

Prepare a written response for an in-class discussion centered on Thomas Edison's list of technologies. This preparation involves several steps:

1. **Reordering Edison's Technologies**: Rearrange the items on Edison's list based on their current usage frequency. Begin with the most frequently used and end with the least used, based on your best guess.
2. **Assigning Significance Percentages**: Allocate a percentage to each item, reflecting its modern-day significance. Ensure that the total percentage for all items equals 100%.
3. **Broadening the Definition of 'the Phonograph'**: When discussing 'the phonograph', consider it as any widely-used sound recording technology today. Feel free to interpret other items on Edison’s list in the context of modern technology.
4. **Supporting Your List**: Justify the order of your list. While you may use statistics and published data to support your argument, the focus should be on your perspective regarding the cultural significance of recording technologies. Include considerations of different cultural and social contexts.
5. **Examining Lower-ranked Items**: Analyze why certain items are at the bottom of your list. Speculate about their potential future significance and the technological, social, and cultural factors that might influence this.
6. **Personal Critical Perspective**: Offer a critique of how technology has evolved since Edison's time. Discuss the sociocultural changes that accompany these technological advancements, expressing both your approval and disapproval of these changes.
